# CV

My resume in JSON Resume format.

## View

**Live versions** (generated by GitHub Actions):
- [HTML](https://danividanivi.github.io/cv/)
- [PDF](https://danividanivi.github.io/cv/resume.pdf)

*Note: If links don't work immediately, the GitHub Actions deployment may still be in progress. You can also build locally using the instructions below.*

## Build Locally

To build locally:

```sh
npm install -g resume-cli
npm install puppeteer
npm install ./danivi-style
resume export index.html --theme danivi-style
resume export resume.pdf --theme danivi-style --format pdf
npm run generate:txt # produces resume.txt (plain text / ATS friendly)
```

### Plain Text Export

The repository includes a plain text generator (`generate-txt.js`) that creates `resume.txt` for ATS systems or quick copy/paste:

```sh
npm run generate:txt
```

Output characteristics:
- Excludes archived work experiences (those with `_archived: true`)
- Uses normalized `YYYY-MM` dates
- ASCII-friendly (special non-breaking spaces and uncommon hyphens removed)
- Sections: Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Languages, References

You can modify `generate-txt.js` to omit references or adjust formatting if needed.

## Automated Build

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically build and deploy the resume to GitHub Pages on every push.

### Build Status
Check the [Actions tab](https://github.com/danividanivi/cv/actions) to see the latest build status.

### Troubleshooting
If the live links don't work:
1. Check if the GitHub Actions build completed successfully
2. Wait a few minutes for GitHub Pages to deploy
3. Build locally using the instructions above

## Dependency Management

This repository uses [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to automatically keep dependencies up to date.

### Configuration
- **Schedule**: Weekly on Mondays at 6:00 PM CET
- **Scope**: All npm dependencies
- **Strategy**: 
  - Creates pull requests for minor and patch updates
  - Ignores major version updates (requires manual review)
  - Special handling for `puppeteer` (major updates ignored)
- **Labels**: Automatically adds `dependencies` and `automated` labels
- **Commit messages**: Prefixed with `deps` or `deps-dev`

### Pull Request Management
- Maximum of 10 open pull requests at once
- Assigns pull requests to repository owner
- Uses descriptive commit messages with scope information

To merge dependency updates:
1. Review the changes in the Dependabot pull request
2. Check if any breaking changes are introduced
3. Test the build locally if needed
4. Merge the pull request
